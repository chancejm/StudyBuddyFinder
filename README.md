# StudyBuddyFinder

### Welcome to Study Buddy Finder!

##### What this App Does.

1. We ask for your name & to select how comfortable you are with various subjects on a scale of 1 to 10.

2. When you Submit your name & subject values we attempt to match you with a student that has the most common self assessed knowledge level with you in as many subjects as possible.

3. Your Results will be displayed with a chart giving you a Visual Representation of you & your potential Study Buddy's self assessed knowledge levels.

### Example Results

#### Legend:
- (+ HTML +) Great Match - Learn it together!

- (+HTML - ++++HTML) You may be able to help your match with this subject.

- (HTML+ - HTML++++) Your Match may be able to help with this subject.

- So (+) symbol on your side means indicates you more comfortable with that subject and vice. versa.
##### Note: (+) symbols indicate self assessed knowledge levels differences. 
##### (Example: ++HTML = 2 levels above match)-(HTML++++ = 4+ levels above You)-(+HTML+ = No Difference)
